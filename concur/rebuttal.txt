Reviewer 1. Left-linear rules are a generalisation of linear ones.  Linear rules only allow to replace a sub-system with another inside a given context, hence no kind of merge is possible. Instead, when working with left-linear rules a rewriting step can additionally merge some items in the context. Left-linear rules allows for a natural modelling via graph rewriting of formalisms such as term rewriting (with collapsing rules), logic programming, string diagrams, and process calculi. The latter two encodings via graph rewriting are witnessed by [27,9]. We will make the presentation more effective, putting additional emphasis on the modelling possibilities offered by left-linear rules in the introduction and inserting additional references to the literature.

Reviewer 2. Thank you for the appreciation. We agree with the specific points you make and will adjust them in the final version. In particular, it is correct that at page 11 the colimit is a single node with two self-loops, but since this applies to both derivations, the remaining considerations are still valid.

Reviewer 3. The reviewer has indeed captured an insight on the parallel application of rules: Mild categorical conditions on the arrows in M (basically, closure with respect to coproduct) guarantee the possibility of executing in parallel two sequentially independent derivations. We will add an explicit remark on this fact in the final version.
