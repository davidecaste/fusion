\begin{proof}[Proof of \autoref{thm:prAtEndxi}]\phantomsection\label{proof:prAtEndxi}The first point of \Cref {def:switc} is obviously satisfied. The second one follows at once since \[m_{\der {E},0}= f_0\circ i_1 \qquad h_{\der {E},1}= g_{1}\circ i_0\] Finally, the third point holds because we already know that \[m_{\der {E},0}= f_0\circ i_1 \qquad h_{\der {E},1}= g_{1}\circ i_0\]\end{proof}
